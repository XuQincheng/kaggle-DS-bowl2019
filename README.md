This repository includes the final project information for the Machine Learning Laboratory - MSDS 621 course.
Our dataset is game play history for the PBS Kids Measure Up! app provided by Kaggle [2019 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2019).
Using the PBS Kids Measure Up app game play data, we created a pipeline to predict how many attempts it would take an individual to complete their next Assessment.
